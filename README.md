# Share Food

## 📋 Overview

Share Food is a learning demo application built with Next.js App Router following a Udemy course. It showcases Next.js’s file-system routing, Server & Client Components, and simple in-memory data handling. Use it to explore basic CRUD operations and nested layouts in the App Router.

## 🚀 Features

- **Next.js App Router**: Uses the `app/` directory, nested layouts, and server-side data fetching.  
- **CRUD Demo**: Create, read, update “food share” posts via built‑in API routes.  
- **Server & Client Components**: Demonstrates data fetching in Server Components and interactivity in Client Components.  
- **Zero Back‑end Setup**: No external database required—data is held in memory or local mock files for demo purposes.
